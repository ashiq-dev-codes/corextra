## 1.1.5

- Added `AppLoggerInterceptor`: a Dio interceptor that logs requests, responses, and errors in a pretty, bordered, color-coded format — one consolidated block per event
- Added `LogColor` enum with ANSI color codes (`red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `reset`) for terminal output
- Added `LogLevel` enum (`info`, `warning`, `error`) for structured log levels, each mapped to a distinct color
- Enhanced `debugLog` with `LogLevel` support for color-coded console output
- Enhanced `AppLogger` with detailed structured logging for requests, responses, and Dio errors
- Updated `dio` to `^5.9.2` and `test` to `^1.31.0`

## 1.1.4

- Updated exception classes (`CorextraException` and subclasses) to use Dart 3 super-parameters for cleaner and more maintainable code
